Endless Runner: "Cosmic Dash"

Concept: You control a spaceship or a simple geometric shape flying forward through an endless tunnel or field of obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging the obstacles.
Core Mechanics:

Player Control: The player can move left and right.
Procedural Generation: Obstacles (like asteroids or simple blocks) are generated continuously ahead of the player.
Collision Detection: The game ends when the player hits an obstacle.
Scoring: The score increases based on time survived or distance traveled.

Additional features:
Add collectible items that give points or temporary power-ups (like a shield).
Introduce different types of obstacles with varied movement patterns.
Implement a speed increase over time to ramp up the difficulty.
Use the particle system to create a trailing engine effect for the player or explosion effects.
